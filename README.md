#Road Lane Line Detection
📌 Overview
The Road Lane Line Detection project aims to detect lane lines on roads in real-time using computer vision techniques. This solution is particularly useful in autonomous driving systems and driver assistance applications. The project uses Python, OpenCV, and machine learning techniques to process video frames, detect lane lines, and overlay them on the original frames.

💡 Features

Noise reduction and smoothing using image preprocessing

Canny edge detection and region of interest masking

Hough Line Transform to detect and draw lane lines

Handles varying road conditions and lighting

Simple and efficient pipeline

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional for plotting)

🚀 How It Works
Frame Extraction: Read video frame by frame using OpenCV.

Grayscale Conversion: Convert the frame to grayscale to reduce computational complexity.

Gaussian Blur: Apply blur to reduce noise.

Canny Edge Detection: Detect edges in the image.

Region of Interest Masking: Focus only on the area of the image where lanes are expected.

Hough Line Transform: Identify and draw lines corresponding to lanes.

Overlay: Combine detected lanes with the original image.

📈 Results
Smooth and accurate detection of lane lines.

Robust against small road imperfections and varying brightness.

Capable of working in real-time using webcam or dashcam footage.

📌 Challenges Faced
Handling different lighting conditions and shadows

Differentiating actual lane lines from road noise

Smoothing out fluctuations between frames for consistent line detection

🧠 Future Improvements
Support for curved roads using polynomial regression

Integration with deep learning for better detection in complex scenarios

Addition of lane change and departure warnings

Use of TensorFlow/Keras for end-to-end deep learning models
